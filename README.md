# LythaPricingUtils

This is a simple desktop utility to calculate prices when listing items on online marketplaces such as Etsy.com (only supported marketplace currently).

An item base-cost can be entered and the utility will take into account sales and listing fees and output the final item price.

LythaPricingUtils is developed in-house for LythaStudios.etsy.com using the cross-platform Lazarus / Free Pascal environment for easy compilation to Windows / Linux / Mac.
