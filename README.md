This is a simple desktop utility to calculate prices when listing items on Etsy.com.

Enter a base-cost and it will take into account Etsy's sales and listing fees and output the final item price.

It is developed in the cross-platform Lazarus / Free Pascal environment for easy compilation to Windows / Linux / Mac.
